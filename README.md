# yarnbomb-website
This website is dedicated to the Riverbend Yarn Bombers in Alton, IL.
The Riverbend Yarn Bombers are a group of women dedicated to 
beautifying their community with yarn based art - either knitted or crocheted. 
Yarn Bombing is considered to be the new graffiti - but it's always 
lovely and temporary!
